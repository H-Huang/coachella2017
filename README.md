# Coachella2017
This will be a flatpage for Daily Bruin's coverage on Coachella:

How the site will be structured:

Landing Page - "Coachella" title at the top, most likely 3 categories for labeled "food", "performances", and "students". Each of these categories, when clicked will link to a separate page

"food" page - mostly photo based. Could be formatted like a photo blog with the image being the center of attention and a short caption appears when you hover over it.

"performances" page - mix of photos and text, each photo will usually be accompanied by an approximately 400 word blurb. Expecting 5 - 10 performances to be written on.

"students" page - This page will come out the earliest. In the beginning will display students' experiences getting ready for Coachella. Then more content will be added for students' experiences at the actual event.
